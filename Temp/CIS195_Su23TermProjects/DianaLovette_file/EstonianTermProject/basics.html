                        <h1>Grammar and Word Order</h1>
                        <p>
                            Estonian has a highly inflectional grammar, which means that word endings change to indicate different grammatical cases, such as nominative, genitive, and accusative. The word order in Estonian is relatively flexible, but the default order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), similar to English. However, because of the inflectional nature of the language, word order can be adjusted without affecting the overall meaning of the sentence.

                        <h1>Cases and Declensions</h1>
                        <p>
                            Estonian nouns, pronouns, and adjectives have 14 grammatical cases. These cases change the forms of the words depending on their function in the sentence. For example, the word "house" in Estonian is "maja," but if we want to say "of the house," it becomes "maja-st" (genitive case). Cases play a crucial role in indicating possession, location, and other relationships between words in a sentence.

                        <h1>Vowel Harmony</h1>
                        <p>
                            Estonian employs a unique feature called vowel harmony, which means that the vowels in a word must be of the same type. There are three degrees of vowel harmony in Estonian: front vowels (ä, ö, ü), back vowels (a, o, u), and neutral vowels (e, i). This rule affects how suffixes are added to words based on the vowels they contain.

                        <h1>No Gender or Articles</h1>
                        <p>
                            Unlike many other languages, Estonian does not have grammatical gender for nouns. Additionally, it lacks definite and indefinite articles (like "the" and "a/an" in English). This makes the language simpler in terms of noun declension and agreement.

                        <p>
                            Estonian verbs are relatively straightforward in terms of conjugation. They don't change based on the subject (no subject-verb agreement). However, they do change according to tense, mood, and aspect. There are three tenses: present, past, and future, as well as different moods like indicative and imperative.

                        <h1>Compounding Words</h1>
                        <p>
                            Estonian is known for its extensive use of compound words. Instead of using separate words, Estonians often combine multiple words to form a new, more descriptive word. This feature allows for a highly expressive and concise way of communication.
