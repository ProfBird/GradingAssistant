            Established on 26 September 1941; The United States Army Military Police Corps (USAMPC) is the uniformed law enforcement branch of the United
            States Army. Investigations are conducted by Military Police Investigators under the Provost Marshal
            General's Office or Special Agents of the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID).</p>

        <p>United States Army Military Police units have combat zone responsibilities in addition to their law
            enforcement duties. These responsibilities include mounted and dismounted patrols, response force
            operations, area damage control, route reconnaissance, cordon and search operations, critical site security,
            and convoy and personnel escorts. Operationally, these duties fall under the "security and mobility support"
            discipline of the Military Police Corps. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Police_Corps_(United_States)">Source: wikipedia</a></p>
