            The Duty belt is the life line of the military police corpman, it contains everything one needs to patrol and keep order. As well as the duty  belt, soldiers upholding the law also utilize their stab-proof vest and patrol car to keep the base under order. A large part of the equipment used is used during 'fieldcycle' or when a unit goes to a training ground for days or weeks at a time. Popular MP gear on the field includes the M2A1 .50 Caliber machine gun and the Mk17 Fully Automatic Grenade Launcher kept mounted on a soldiers gun truck or MRAP/MATV (mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle/MRAP All Terrain Vehicle).
