           The 'Field Cycle' is an operational period that occurs in a battalions training calander when all the work put in to studying and training in the last cycle is put to use out in the wilderness under mock operations. For weeks at a time units will pack up their gear and drive out to remote training facilities and grounds to set up FOB's (Forward Operating Bases) where training excercises are planned and squads are sent out on missions to evaluate their effectivness and skills during scenarios often prepared for during times of war. This includes performing checkpoints, access control sites, detainee camps, and general patrols on guntruck of surrounding areas.
