        <!--Loved the road cycles :)-->
        <p>
            The road cycle is the bread and butter of the military police corp, where units within a battalian take monthly turns patrolling on one of three eight hour shifts around their base. this includes pulling traffic, responding to calls, and a lot of meeting up with your squad in remote places to smoke and share stories on shift. A lot of my own time patrolling was providing a presence at busy intersections to dissuade people from speeding through areas or at one of the gates turning away people not authorized to be on base. By far one of the best patrols to get put on was about an hour away at one of the MWR (Morale, wellfare, and relaxation) sites at the beach. a long federally owned stretch of beach and cabins, that yes people still needed federal ID to enter.
