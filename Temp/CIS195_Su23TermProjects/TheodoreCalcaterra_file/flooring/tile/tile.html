            These are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber
            or glass tiles for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid
            in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into mortar consisting of sand, cement and often a latex
            additive. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor grout, but
            traditionally
            mortar was used.

        <h2>Care</h2>
        <!--Information obtained from: https://www.thespruce.com/tile-cleaning-mistakes-1901117-->
        <ol>
            <li>
                Sweep or Vacuum the Tile. Make sure you get into the corners, where dirt tends to pile up.
                A microfiber duster picks up dust and hair easily, and if you can, opt for a vacuum here—vacuums
                extract dirt, which is ideal when cleaning tile.
            </li>

            <li>
                Combine the Cleaner With Warm Water. Dip a microfiber mop—not a sponge mop—into the solution.
                Squeeze out the excess water so that it's damp and not soaking.
            </li>

            <li>
                Run the Mop Over the Floor in Even, Gentle Strokes. Follow a pattern as you move through the room,
                so there's not an inch of the floor that gets missed.
            </li>

            <li>
                Clean the Grout. Spray the grout with a cleaner made specifically for grout, or mix up a bleach solution
                (using gloves, so you don't get bleach on your bare hands). Let it sit for a few minutes, and then rinse
                it off.
            </li>

            <li>
                Dry the Floor With a Clean Cloth. If your tile is prone to forming water spots, dry it with a clean
                cloth immediately after mopping.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>"Vinyl flooring made its debut at the 1933 Chicago “A Century of Progress” Exposition.
            Budget-friendly,
            resilient, and flame resistant, vinyl composite tiles stirred plenty of interest. Unfortunately, vinyl was a
            rare
            material for floors until after WWII. War meant that materials like petroleum were in short supply"&mdash;
