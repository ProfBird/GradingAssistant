        <h2>Description</h2>
        <!--The information below was copied from the Wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpet-->
        <p>
            A carpet is a textile floor covering typically consisting of an upper layer of pile attached to a backing.
            The pile was traditionally made from wool, but since the 20th century synthetic fibers such as
            polypropylene,
            nylon, or polyester have often been used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually
            consists of twisted tufts that are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term carpet is
            often used in a similar context to the term rug, but rugs are typically considered to be smaller than a room
            and not attached to the floor.

        <h2>Care</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Vacuum with the rug-beater brush at least once a week to suck up dirt and dust that can dull the carpet
                and
                mat down the fibers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every 12 to 18 months, have a pro give it a deep cleaning to remove embedded grimeâ€”and
                keep your warranty intact.
            </li>

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">History of Carpet</h2>
        <blockquote>"The very first carpet were rugs made from sheep wool or goat hair. They came onto the scene as
            early
            as 2,000 or 3,000 B.C. Carpets are believed to have originated somewhere in the Middle East, although
            exactly
            where is still unknown. These early carpets were primarily used to make sitting on the ground more
            comfortable.
