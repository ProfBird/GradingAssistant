        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <!--We build a custom home and deciding on flooring was a challenge.  We needed to educate ourselves.-->
        <p>
            Starting in 2017, my husband and I had decided on building a new how - a custom home. There is a lot of
            planning that goes into building a house, and one of the largest challenges is trying to stay on budget. Not
            an easy task.<br>
            We originally wanted oak hardwood through out the house but found hardwood rather expensive, and we wanted
            the house to be a bit more inviting and wanted to use flooring in areas that would last.<br>
            So our journey began.<br>
            We decided on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carpeting
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bedrooms
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Tile
                <ul>
                    <li>Foyer and Entryway</li>
                    <li>Mudroom</li>
                    <li>Laundry Room</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Hardwood
                <ul>
                    <li>Kitchen</li>
                    <li>Dinning Room</li>
                    <li>Living Room</li>
                    <li>Hallways</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Pages</h2>
        <!--My idea was to help people explore flooring options and continue to explore-->
        <p>
            In the following webpages, we wanted to provide you with some of the information that we collected
            while deciding on flooring. Flooring is a huge part of the house as should not be taken lightly.
            Flooring types, color, direction of layout are also to take into consideration when making a decision.
            We used a copy of our blueprints to lay out which flooring goes where and how it needs to be laid out.
            This helped our installers immensely.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Importance of Flooring</h2>
        <blockquote>"Many times the floor is not given the importance it deserves when one considers the definition of
            the
            interior design of a floor. Often, we think more about other elements that go on top of it, including what
            to put
            on the walls. We take it as something given that largely determines all the rest. If we think about it well,
            it is
            a large surface that impacts on the visual perspective of space, sensory reach and conditions the whole.
            Therefore
            , your good choice is of vital importance for the success of the project."&mdash;
