        <p>
            Vinyl flooring is a product composed of several layers of different materials sandwiched together to
            form a highly durable, practical and affordable floor covering. The two main types of vinyl flooring are
            Luxury Vinyl Tiles and vinyl roll. Both LVT and vinyl roll are made from the same materials, however,
            they're
            constructed differently to produce different effects. For example the plank format is ideal to imitate
            natural wood. Find out more about the composition of Tarkett LVT and vinyl roll flooring.

        <h2>Care</h2>
        <!--Information obtained from: https://www.carpetone.com/flooring-guide/care-and-maintenance/care-for-vinyl-->
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start With Pick-up. The best way to clean vinyl floors is to start by picking up loose dirt. While it
                may not seem like dirt can cause issues on your vinyl, small rocks or pieces of dirt that are stuck in
                your shoes can be sharp. Over time, they can scratch the surface, which is why picking up dirt is an
                excellent place to start.
            </li>

            <li>
                Sweep or Vacuum. To remove dirt, you can sweep or vacuum. Be sure to turn your beater bar off on your
                vacuum to prevent damages. We recommend that you do this at least once a week. If you have a dirt
                driveway,
                pets, or kids, you may need to sweep or vacuum more often.
            </li>

            <li>
                Vinyl Floor Cleaner. For the next step, it is best to consult your flooring manufacturer for an approved
                vinyl
                floor cleaner. If you don not have access to the manufacturers guidelines, we recommend our Resista
                Resilient
                Cleaner. This cleaner is approved for Carpet One luxury vinyl floors as well as most luxury vinyl
                planks, tiles,
                or resilient floors. When using this cleaner, be sure to use a mop that does not have tough bristles.
                These bristles can damage the protective layer on your vinyl floors. Mops that are not abrasive are the
                best
                option to use when cleaning and caring for vinyl.

        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">When did vinyl flooring debut?</h2>
        <blockquote>"Vinyl flooring made its debut at the 1933 Chicago “A Century of Progress” Exposition.
            Budget-friendly,
            resilient, and flame resistant, vinyl composite tiles stirred plenty of interest. Unfortunately, vinyl was a
            rare
            material for floors until after WWII. War meant that materials like petroleum were in short supply"&mdash;
