        <h2>Description</h2>
        <!--The information below was copied from the following site:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_flooring-->
        <p>
            Solid hardwood floors are made of planks milled from a single piece of timber. Solid hardwood floors
            were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams
            of a building known as joists or bearers. With the increased use of concrete as a subfloor in some parts
            of the world, engineered wood flooring has gained some popularity. However, solid wood floors are still
            common and popular, but are commonly more expensive in the United States and considered higher end. Solid
            wood floors have a thicker wear surface and can be sanded and finished more times than an engineered wood
            floor. It is not uncommon for homes in New England, Eastern Canada, USA, and Europe to have the original
            solid wood floor still in use today.

        <blockquote>"Real hardwood flooring is incredibly unique! Like a fingerprint, no two hardwood floors are the
            same.
            This is because no two trees are alike. You can have different grain patterns, colors, mass, and more! Real
            wood
            is characterized by texture variation of the wood grain, which is why you wonâ€™t find two planks of hardwood
            flooring that appear exactly alike. If you decide to purchase laminate flooring, however, it has a
            pre-designed
            pattern that imitates natural wood. So with laminate floors, repetition in the pattern is common."&mdash;
