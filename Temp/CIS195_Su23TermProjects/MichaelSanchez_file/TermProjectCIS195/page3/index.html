    <h2>St. George and the Dragon </h2>
    <p>
        The legend of St. George and the Dragon is an iconic tale from Western mythology. In this story, a fearsome
        dragon terrorizes a kingdom, demanding a daily human sacrifice until the princess becomes the unfortunate
        victim. St. George, a valiant knight, arrives to save the princess and confronts the dragon in a battle of good
        versus evil. Ultimately, he slays the dragon, symbolizing the triumph of courage and righteousness over
        malevolence and chaos. This legend serves as a timeless reminder of the hero's journey and the inherent human
        desire to vanquish darkness in the pursuit of justice.

        In Chinese folklore, the dragon is a revered creature symbolizing power, good fortune, and prosperity. The tale
        of the Chinese Dragon centers on its divine origins and its benevolent nature. The dragon is associated with the
        emperor and serves as a protector of the land and its people. Chinese New Year celebrations often feature dragon
        dances, with the dragon winding through streets to bring good luck and ward off evil spirits. This story conveys

    <h2> The Scandinavian Dragon Fafnir </h2>
    <p>
        In Norse mythology, the story of the dragon Fafnir is one of greed and transformation. Fafnir was once a human
        prince who, consumed by greed, transformed into a dragon to guard a hoard of cursed treasure. The hero Sigurd
        takes on the challenge of slaying Fafnir to claim the treasure and is ultimately successful. The legend of
        Fafnir explores the consequences of greed and the notion that wealth can bring both power and corruption,
        imparting a cautionary message about the pitfalls of excessive desire.
