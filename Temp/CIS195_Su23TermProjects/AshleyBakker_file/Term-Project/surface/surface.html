        <p>Surface embriodery is the simplest form of embroidery, consisting of a variety of stitches sewn freely through a material's surface. Majority of embroidery falls under this term like redwork, goldwork, or crewel, all of which use specific colors or types of thread to create the same types of stitches. You can freely stitch to create designs or follow a printed/drawn pattern outline directly on the surface. Here are some things you'll need to get and techniques you can use to get started! </p>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Needle:</strong> A standard embroidery/crewel needle will work for most projects, which includes a medium eye&mdash;the opening at the end of the needle which thread passes through&mdash;and a sharp tip for piercing tight fabrics. Depending on how many strands of thread you use, you may need a larger sized needle to fit all the strands into the eye and through the surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Fabric:</strong> Any sort of fabric or surface can be used.</li>
                <li><strong>Hoop:</strong> A hoop is the easiest and cheapest method to stretch the fabric taut so the needle can easily pass through. There are a variety of hoop sizes, so depending on the project size you may use a different size. It's best practice to have a selection of hoop sizes, but you can stick to one medium-sized if needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Thread:</strong> Any thread material can be used, but embroidery floss is the most common. It comes in six individual strands which can be separated to create thinner stitches using one strand, up to all six for a thicker stitch.</li>
                <li><strong>Extras:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scissors to cut the thread.</li> 
                        <li>You can also experiment with embellishments like beads, pearls or sequins as well.</li>
                        <li>Patience, some designs can be pretty complex, but even the simplest of patterns require time to get every stitch in place.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Loading the Hoop</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by laying the fabric down flat with the pattern facing down.</li>
                <li>Then, unscrew the hoop and center the inner circle of the hoop on top of the fabric.</li> 
                <li>Flip over the fabric and hoop together, making sure the design is centered in the hoop.</li> 
                <li>Place the larger circle of the hoop over the fabric and around the smaller circle.</li> 
                <li>Finish by securing the hoop by tightening the bolt, making sure the fabric is taut.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Stitches</h2>
        <p>There are hundreds of stitches you can use in embroidery, and the best method to learn them is visually. Here are some video links to lists of some of these stitches. I recommend learning the running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, satin stitch, french knot, and woven wheel to get started.</p>
