        <p>Cross stitching is a form of hand embroidery which consists of creating x-shaped stitches, or "cross stitches" on a grid-like fabric. There are two types of cross stitching, counted cross stiching and stamped cross stitching. Counted needlework means you follow a separate printed pattern guide, generally starting from the center of the pattern to align with the center of the fabric and counting outwards. Meanwhile, with stamped cross stitch, the pattern is printed directly on the fabric and you stitch on top of it. Both methods produce the same output and require the same stitches. Here's what you'll need to get started!</p>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Needle:</strong> For cross stitching, a tapestry needle is needed as it has a larger eye and blunt tip. The fabric used for counted stitches like cross stitch already have open holes, so a pointed tip isn't needed to go through the fabric. </li>
                <li><strong>Fabric:</strong> Aida cloth and linen are most commonly used due to them being woven fabrics, meaning they're made with equal vertical and horizontal blocks. This makes it easier to keep the stitches equal in size. </li>
                <li><strong>Hoop:</strong> Just like with surface embroidery, you will need a hoop to hold the fabric tight. Refer to <a href="../surface/surface.html">Surface Embroidery</a> on how to set up the fabric.</li>
                <li><strong>Thread:</strong> Embroidery floss is the best option for cross stitching, which uses 1-4 strands depending on how visible you want the X's to be.</li>
                <li><strong>Extras:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scissors to cut the thread.</li> 
                        <li>Aida cloth and linen tend to fray easily, so before you begin you may want to fold tape around the edges or sew around it using a blanket stitch.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>How to Cross Stitch</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Following the Pattern</h3>
            <p>If you're doing counted cross stitch you'll want to mark the center of your pattern. Do this by counting the height and width of the pattern and cutting it in half. If you're left with an even number, choose if you want to go to the left or right stitch and top or bottom stitch of the middle point. Then, to mark this on the fabric you fold the fabric in quarters, and where the folds meet in the middle is the center. Mark it by widening the hole using the needle. For stamped cross stitch, just follow the colors directly on the fabric, starting wherever you wish.</p>
            <h3>Stitching</h3>
            <p>Now, onto the cross stitching, you'll want to start by threading your needle, but without knoting the end. Begin in the bottom left corner of the X and go to the top right. If you're making a row of stitches, you can continue the row from bottom left to top right before crossing over again. Doing this will leave a clean back with vertical lines. As you're doing this, you'll want to tuck the loose end under 3-5 of those vertical stitches on the back. Once you reach the end of the row, you can now go cross back over the stitches from bottom right to top left this time. Now you've finished one line! You can continue onto a new line or finish by weaving the excess under 3-5 stitches again using the needle. Repeat for each color or new line!</p>
            <h3>Fractional Stitches</h3>
            <p>There are some other stitches you can try as well, starting from the quarter stitch up to three-quarter stitch. The quarter stitches are made by stitching into the center of an Aida square opposed to the corners. The half stitch is simply the bottom left to top right stitch that makes up the full cross stitch.</p>
