        <p>This kind of hand embroidery is similar to rug tufting, where loops are "punched" or pushed into the fabric to create a fluffy 3D effect. Unlike typical embroidery, you don't need to pull on the string to tighten it, just continuously pushing the thread into the fabric. Although there is considered to be a "wrong" side to punch needle, you can choose to display the flatter stitched side if you prefer, or even mix techniques. There isn't a wide selection of stitches you have to learn either, which makes it easy for beginners.</p>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Needle:</strong> As its name entails, you will need a special punch needle to hold your thread. It has a metal tip with a hole through it for the thread to go through.</li>
                <li><strong>Fabric:</strong> Monk's cloth or canvas work best to hold the thread.</li>
                <li><strong>Hoop:</strong> Just like with surface embroidery, you will need a hoop to hold the fabric tight. Refer to <a href="../surface/surface.html">Surface Embroidery</a> on how to set up the fabric. It's especially important for punch needle embroidery that the fabric is tight, so you may have to tighten it using a tool.</li>
                <li><strong>Thread:</strong> Embroidery floss with all six strands will work for punch needle, but for the typical thick loops, yarn is used.</li>
                <li><strong>Extras:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scissors to cut the thread.</li> 
                        <li>Monk's cloth frays easily just like aida cloth for cross stitching, so before you begin you may want to fold tape around the edges or sew around it using a blanket stitch.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>How to Punch Needle</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Start by threading your punch needle with your chosen material. This will vary depending on where you get your punch needle from, so follow the attached instructions, making sure to leave a long tail out like with standard needles.</li>
        <li>Now, you can begin pushing the needle through the fabric, following along the pattern. Make sure to push straight down and through the fabric before bringing it back up.</li> 
        <li>When bringing the needle back up, make sure to keep it close to the surface before going back through again.</li> 
        <li>It's best to outline the section you're working on before filling the area completely. The side you are working on is considered the "wrong" side and the loops will appear on the other side, unless you prefer the flat stitches.</li> <li>Once you finished, you don't need to knot the start or end of the thread on the working side, but trim it to at least an inch away from the fabric.</li> 
        <li>Repeat for each section and color!</li>
        </ol>
