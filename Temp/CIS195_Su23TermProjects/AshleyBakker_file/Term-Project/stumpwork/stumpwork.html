        <p>A lot of stitches used in surface embroidery are used in stumpwork embroidery, specifically the ones that add a 3D effect. Stumpwork embroidery, also called raised embroidery, uses these stitches along with other techniques to raise the design on top of the surface. Some techniques include using padding/stuffing like foam or felt, using wires or beads to structure the threads, or even cutting out fabric with it's own embroidered design and applying it to the main piece, called slips. Any method that allows for thread to pop off its surface is welcomed. </p>
