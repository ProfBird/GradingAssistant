        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>As stated above, embroidery is the process of decorating any surface using a needle to apply stitches. This technique has been around for thousands of years, most primarily used to decorate clothing and tapestries. Over time, many styles and techniques have been created for different uses in a variety of cultures to fit their needs and style. It's important to note that you can embroider on practically any surface that can lay flat and allows a needle to pierce through, not just fabric. This can include paper, egg shells or even wood.</p>
        <p>The four styles covered here are popular now in modern-day embroidery, but are also unique in their techniques and final designs. From the most general style of surface embroidery comes more specific styles like cross stitch, punch needle, and stumpwork embroidery. They each require their own materials and types of stitches to create a variety of effects. However, they all require similar materials like a needle, thread, fabric, and a hoop or other method to stretch the fabric to hold the thread securely. Check out each page for more information on each specific style. For quick reference, here is a table of the four embroidery styles and their necessary materials:</p>
