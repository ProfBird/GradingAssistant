	 <h1>Our Club History</h1>
	<p>
		In 2013 the concept of like Anime or Manga was still being stigmatized. So, Brandon Schmidt founded the Anime & Manga Club and became our first club president. 
		This club served as a safe place for fans of Anime and Manga to come together and to talk about all things anime and manga related. From then the club had one goal, 
		to go to an Anime Convention. So, we worked hard, until in 2018, we finally achieved our goal. We as a whole attended the convention Eucon 2018. Following that we 
		possibly had one of the most active periods in our club history.

	<p>
		<br>Though in 2019, the club had to temporarily close due to the pandemic. after attempting on make an online entity to continue club activities. It was hard to do so. 
		So, we had to close our doors.
	</p>
	<p>
		<br>Until in late 2022, the club was brought back by one of our former presidents, and because of it we can still be a safe place for all those who love and watch anime. 
		Throughout our history we've had five presidents and have remained one of the longest tenured student clubs. Throughout all of this we still have high hopes for what’s to 
		come from the future and will still spread our love of anime to those who want to participate with us. So, will you?
