        <h3>HOW WE MET</h3>
        <p>
          Our story began at a friend's house, surrounded by laughter and good
          times. Our eyes met, and in that instant, something special sparked
          between us. Conversations flowed easily, revealing our shared
          interests and quirks. We talked like we'd known each other forever.
          The more we talked, the more it felt like we'd found something
          special. As the evening turned into night, we realized that our
          meeting was just the beginning. From that day on, our journey has been
          filled with love and laughter. It was as if we were meant to find each
          other that night.
