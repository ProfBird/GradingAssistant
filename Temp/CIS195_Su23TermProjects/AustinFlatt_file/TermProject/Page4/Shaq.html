        <p>Coming in at the fourth spot is Shaquille O'Neal</p>
        <p>Shaq started his NBA career in 1992 when he was drafted 1st overall by the Orlando Magic.
            Shaq was over 7 feet tall and 300 plus pounds yet somehow was able to move and perform like someone who was
            a foot shorter and 100 pounds lighter.
            Due to his freak of nature genetics Shaq was an absolute unstoppable force that nobody could even dream of
            rivaling.
            Shaq's size was such an issue that new rules were put in place in the NBA due to his impact on the game.
            Shaq earned the nick name "Diesel" for his unprecedented size and speed, much like a large diesel truck.
            Throughout his career Shaq won four NBA championships, a MVP award and was selected to the NBA all-star team
            15 times.
