        <p>Coming in at the third spot is Kobe Bryant</p>
        <p>Kobe Bryant started his NBA career in 1996 when he was drafted 13th overall by the Charlotte Hornets who then
            traded him to the Lakers before the season started.
            Kobe was another player who was expected to do major things before he had even played a NBA game.
            It didnt take long for Kobe to live up to the public expectations of him, delivering electrifying
            performances night after night.
            Kobe was given the nick name "Black Mamba" for his venomous finishing abilities.
            Through out his career Kobe won five NBA championships, two MVP awards and was selected to the NBA all-star
            team eighteen times.
