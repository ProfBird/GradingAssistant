        <p>Coming in at the number two spot is Lebron James</p>
        <p>Lebron James started his NBA career in 2003 when he was drafted first overall by his hometown team the
            Cleveland Cavaliers.
            Before even stepping onto a NBA court Lebron James was worth 200 million dollars due to his various sponsers
            and shoe deal.
            Lebron proved himself to be worthy of the hype after just his first game delivering a doubt silencing
            performance.
            Lebron was given the nickname "King James" and has proven time and time again that he is deserving of such a
            name.
            Through out his career Lebron has secured four NBA championships, four MVP awards and has been voted a NBA
            all-star nineteen times.
            Twenty years later and Lebron is still dominating the league and competing for championships.
