    <P>Coming in at the number one spot is Michael Jordan.</P>
    <p>Michael Jordan started his NBA career in 1984 when he was drafted third overall by the Chicago Bulls.
      Jordan was quickly recognized as one of the best talents in the game after just a few months in the NBA.
      While he was a prolific scorer and had defensive ability that could rival anyone what he really became known for
      was his dunking ability.
      Michael was tagged with the nickname "Air Jordan", a nickname so iconic even people who couldnt care less about
      basketball knew who you were referencing.
      Over his career Michael won six NBA championships, was named MVP four times and had fourteen NBA all-star
      selections.
