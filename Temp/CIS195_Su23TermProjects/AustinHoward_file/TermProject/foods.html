        <h1>Bearded Dragon Diet and Nutrition </h1>
        <p><h2>Water:</h2>
        Your beardie should have constant access to water. Use a water bowl that’s large enough to allow the bearded dragon to submerge most of their body for soaking and drinking purposes. Many bearded dragons enjoy defecating in their water bowls, so changing the water daily is critical. Clean the bowl daily with soap and water.</p>
        <p><h2>Dragon Food:</h2>
            Bearded dragons are omnivores. Baby beardies eat mostly insects, but should be introduced to greens early on. If they are not introduced to veggies and fruits early, owners will find it hard to transition them to a mainly herbivorous diet later in life. For adult bearded dragons, leafy greens should make up the majority of their diet.</p>
        <p>Clean your beardie’s salad bowl daily, with warm water and soap. Be sure to remove any food remainders before they become moldy or dry. Keep fresh food out of the direct light to prevent drying. </p>
        <p><h2>Insects:</h2>
            Live insects should make up 20-30% of an adult bearded dragon’s diet. Recommended insects include crickets, dubia roaches, mealworms, phoenix worms and hornworms. The insects should be no larger than ½ the width of your beardie’s face. Never feed a bearded dragon too many insects in a single sitting because the exoskeleton of most insects contains chitin, which can be difficult to digest.</p>
