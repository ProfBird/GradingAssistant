        <h1>How to Care for Your Pet Bearded Dragon</h1>
        <p><h2>Bearded Dragon Cages and Housing:</h2>

            An ideal bearded dragon cage will keep in humidity and heat, and also be easy to clean. We recommend glass tanks because they’re easy to maintain and most comfortable for your beardie friend. Cages made of wire mesh can be hard on a bearded dragon’s toe nails, while plastic containers lock in too much humidity.</p>
            <p>Bearded dragons need plenty of space in their cage. The size needed depends on the size and age of your beardie.</p>

            <li>For a baby, use a 20 gallon glass tank</li>
            <li>For a juvenile, use a 40 gallon glass tank</li>
            <li>For an adult - 120 gallon glass tank (or larger)</li>

            <p><h2>Logs, Rocks and Plants:</h2>

                Bearded dragons love to climb and they’ll enjoy crawling around obstacles placed inside their cage, or basking on a log beneath their heat lamp. You can put rocks, plants and logs into their cage, as long as they’re purchased from a reputable site or store. Because of the risk of bugs, diseases, and parasites, you should never place items that you find outdoors into your beardie’s tank. </p>
            <p>To keep your bearded dragon safe, check to make sure that any rocks or logs are a safe distance from heat lamps.</p>
            <p><h2>Bearded Dragon Substrate:</h2>

                Do not use sand, Vita-sand or gravel in your beardie’s cage. These may seem like a natural choice, but they can create impactions, a type of blockage in the gastrointestinal tract, because beardies love to lick things including the bottom of their cage! They will also accidently ingest sand when trying to eat if fed on these substances. Bearded dragons constantly use their tongues to get an idea of where they are. If they ingest too much sand, they will likely develop an impaction and require veterinary care. </p>
            <p>Many people glue together slate or tile to create a basking ledge and floor for the tank. This is a great option because it’s easy to clean. Paper towels also make for an easy, healthy substrate for your beardie’s cage. Feces will be easy to spot on the white towels and you can quickly replace them with a fresh stock.  Repticarpet can also be used to line the tank.</p>
