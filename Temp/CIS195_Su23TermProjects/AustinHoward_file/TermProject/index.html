            <p>The average bearded dragon lives to the age of 8 or 10, but with proper care they can live longer. In fact, a healthy diet and the right living conditions can have a significant impact on the lifespan of your pet bearded dragon. </p> 
            <p>AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WHERE TO BUY YOUR BEARDED DRAGON PET:</p>
            <p>If you’re considering buying a pet beardie, make sure you go to a reputable bearded dragon breeder or adopt from someone who took good care of their pet. As a bearded dragon vet, we often treat lizards who have parasites or other illnesses as a result of poor living conditions.</p>
