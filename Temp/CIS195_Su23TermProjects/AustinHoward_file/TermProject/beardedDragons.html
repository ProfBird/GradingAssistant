        <h1>The Natural History of Bearded Dragons</h1>
        <p>Bearded dragons originated in Australia and New Guinea. In nature, they live in savannahs, sub-tropical or arid woodlands, deserts and shrublands. There are 8 known bearded dragon species, but the ones most commonly found in homes are in the Pogona genus. All beardies are in the Agamid lizard family. You can recognize an Agamid lizard because they have what’s known as acrodont teeth. This means that their teeth lay on the top of the jaw bone superficially, making them easy to fracture and replace. The front teeth of a bearded dragon are regularly replaced, unlike the back teeth. (It’s important to monitor the oral health of your bearded dragon. If you have any concerns, contact us and we can help.) </p>
        <p> <h2>Beardies as House Pets:</h2> <br>
            The domestication of bearded dragons is a relatively new phenomenon that gained popularity in the 1990s. Part of their rise may be attributed to their cameos in many movies including Harry Potter: Chamber of Secrets, Holes and Nim’s Island, to name a few.</p>
        <p> <h2>Common Breeds of Bearded Dragons:</h2> <br>
                The most popular species of beardie is the P. vitticeps, also known as the Central or Inland bearded dragon. Calm in nature and relatively small (~ 24 inches with the tail), they make a great house pet. You can recognize these beardies by their softer, triangular face. </p>
        <p>Another common breed of bearded dragon is the P. barbata, AKA the common or Eastern bearded dragon. Smaller than the Central beardies, they are growing in popularity. This species has sharper features than the P. vitticeps, although they will also grow to ~24 inches with the tail.

            The P. henrylawsoni, also called the Rankin’s dragon or the Pygmy bearded dragon, is another common type of bearded dragon.  At just 12 inches long, people love their practicality. Some pet owners are attracted to these lizards because they come in a variety of colors. Many breeders take pride in the different color “morphs” that they can breed.</p>
