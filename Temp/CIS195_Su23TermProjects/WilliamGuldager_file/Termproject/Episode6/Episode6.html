            and
            Han from the Hutts.
            leia freed Han from carbonite and they are both in cells.
            Luke gets thrown in a pit with the Rancore, a giant beast in an underground cage.
            He kills it by dropping a large gate on its head.
            Luke is then brought up to the sarlac pit where he will be thrown in for trying to save his friends.
            At the last second R2D2 shoots Luke his lightsaber and Lando starts shoving guards into the pit.
            Luke breaks Boba fetts jetpack and Boba falls into the sarlac pit.
            Leia kills Jabba while this is happening.
            He saves Leia and Han and Luke goes back to Dagobah to complete his training.
            He sees that Yoda will die soon and yoda tells him that Leia is his twin sister and Vader is indeed his
            father.
            The Rebels find that the Empire is building an even bigger Death Star but they think it is under
            construction
            but it is protected by a force field that is set up on the planet Endor.
            So the Rebels go to Endor and meet the teddy bear creatures called Ewoks.
            They capture the rebels and bring them to their camp.
            They think C3P0 is their god because he is so shiny.
            C3P0 convinces the Ewoks to help them fight the Stormtroopers at the force field genrator.
            They overpower the Empire and turn off the forcefield.
            The rebels get in their space ships to fight a battle by the Death Star.
            Luke lets himself get captured and unsuccesfully tries to get his father to leave the dark side.
            Darth Sideous reveals himself to Luke and tells him the plan was a trap and the Death Star is actually
            working!
            Darth Sideous tries to get Luke to join his father in the dark side.
            Luke duels Darth Vader and bests him and cuts off one of his prosthetic limbs.
            Luke tells Darth Sideous he will never join the dark side.
            Darth sideous tries to shock Luke to death and Darth Vader lunges out and throws Darth Sideous down a chasm.
            Darth Vaer's suit is malfunctioning from being shocked and luke reveals his helmet to see his father one
            time
            before he dies.
            Darth Vader is redeemed by the force and he becomes a force ghost.
            Lando flying the Falcon blows up the new Death Star and saves the day.
            The Rebels throw a giant party with the Ewoks on Endor and Luke tells Leia that they are siblings.
            The Empire is deafeated and the force ghosts of Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, and Obi-wan enjoy the show with
