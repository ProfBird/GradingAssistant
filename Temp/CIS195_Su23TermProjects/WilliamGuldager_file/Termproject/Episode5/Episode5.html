        <h2>
            The rebels are on a snowy planet named Hoth.
            The Empire sends some probes out into space to find them.
            Luke tries to talk to Obi-wan with the force and gets grabbed by a Wampa.
            Han rescues him but gets spotted by the probe.
            The Rebels begin evacuating while the Emipre tries to attack them.
            They escape and Luke goes to Dagobah to train because force ghost Obi-wan told him he should.
            Luke gets there and finds Yoda. A senile green frog to teach him the force.
            Luke trains for awhile but senses his friends are in trouble.
            So he goes to Cloud City to meet up with his friends.
            The Rebels go to Cloud City to ask Hans friend Lando Calrissian for shelter but it was a trap.
            Vader catches them and luke arrives after han solo is frozen in carbonite and Boba Fett takes him to Jabba
            the
            Hutt
            on Tatooine.
            The other Rebels escape with landos help on the Millennium Falcon.
            Luke duels Vader and loses his hand and learns that Vader is his father.
            He refuses Vaders offer to join the dark side and leaps off the balcony
            onto the Millennium Falcon where they end the movie plotting to get Han back from the Hutts.
