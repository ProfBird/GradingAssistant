        <h2>
            We follow a young padawan Obi wan Kenobi and his jedi Master Qui Gon Jin who were sent on a diplomatic
            mission
            to stop a blockade on Naboo's recources.
            The jedi come to find out this blockade is in preparation for an invasion. They must take the queen to
            safety and inform the jedi council.
            They are chased in their escape and need to make an emergency landing at Tatooine. They meet a young Anakin
            Skywalker and try to free him from his slavery.
            A sith lord by the name of Darth Maul ambushes them before they leave and the jedis are confused because
            they thought the siths went extinct. 
            They leave the dessert planet of Tatooine and go to Coruscant to inform the council about the blockade, the
            invasion
            to come, and the possible talents of Anakin.
            The council thinks anakin is unfit to be trained by them. Qui Gon Jin dissagrees. The group head back to
            Naboo and
            prepare to take back and fight the invaders.
            A giant fight breaks out and the queen takes back her throne. Meanwhile the jedis are ambushed once again by
            the
            mysterious sith lord darth maul.
            Anakin gets into a spaceship and ends up destroying the trade federations spaceship that was blockading
            Naboo's cargo.
            In the end Qui Gon Jin is killed by the sith lord and Obi wan kills Dath Maul and promises to a dying Qui
            Gon that
            he will train Anakin to be a jedi.
            A giant parade is thrown after the battle and everyone recieves awards and the movie ends.
