        The GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 and 2500 pickup trucks were released in August 1998 as 1999 models. The
        "classic" light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks were continued in production for that first year alongside the new
        models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued until 2000, with the new
        GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) released a year later.

        A small refresh for 2003 models was introduced in 2002, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the
        audio and HVAC controls. The 2007 GMT800 trucks, built after the new GMT900 had gone on sale, used the name
        Classic to denote the difference between the two generations.

    <p class="p">
        The GMT900 generation of the Silverado/Sierra arrived in the last quarter of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a
        redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as power increases on certain engines. Like the
        previous generation GMT800's and earlier C/K lines, it shares styling cues with the GMT900 SUVs of the same
        year. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups have improved aerodynamics over their predecessors thanks to steeply
        raked windshields and tighter panel gaps which help improve fuel economy. The previous GMT800 models were
        continued through 2007 badged as "Classic", just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800's
        introduction.
