        From 1960 to 1999, the Silverado 1500 was officially called the C/K. This pickup is one of GM's best-selling
        vehicles ever. The name "Silverado 1500" comes from one of the C/K's special trims that was used for years. The
        Silverado was the first truck to use hydroforming, a way of making lightweight, durable steel.

        The term pickup is of unknown origin. It was used by Studebaker in 1913. By the 1930s, "pick-up" (hyphenated)
        had become the standard term.[6][unreliable source]

    <p class="p">
        Development of the third-generation C/K trucks began in 1968; vehicle components underwent simulated testing on
        computers before the first prototype pickups were even built for real-world testing.[4] The finished product
        would become revolutionary in appearance, breaking away from typical American pickup truck design of the era
        (including the cab). The exterior design underwent scrutiny in the wind tunnel to optimize its aerodynamics and
        fuel economy.[5] While distinguished by its straight-lined and boxy appearance, GM named the third-generation
        C/K the "Rounded Line" series, succeeding the "Action Line" C/K trucks.[3]
