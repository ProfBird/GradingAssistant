        A pickup truck or pickup is a light-duty truck that has an enclosed cabin, and a back end made up of a cargo bed
        that is enclosed by three low walls with no roof (this cargo bed back end sometimes consists of a tailgate and
        removable covering).[1] In Australia and New Zealand, both pickups and coup√© utilities are called utes, short
        for utility vehicle. In South Africa, people of all language groups use the term bakkie, a diminutive of bak,
        Afrikaans for "basket".

        Once a work or farming tool with few creature comforts, in the 1950s U.S. consumers began purchasing pickups for
        lifestyle reasons, and by the 1990s, less than 15% of owners reported use in work as the pickup truck's primary
        purpose.[2] In North America, the pickup is mostly used as a passenger car[3] and accounts for about 18% of
        total vehicles sold in the United States.[4] Full-sized pickups and SUVs are an important source of revenue for
        major car manufacturers such as GM, Ford, and Stellantis's Ram Trucks Division, accounting for more than
        two-thirds of their global pretax earnings, though they make up just 16% of North American vehicle production.
        These vehicles have a high profit margin and a high price tag; in 2018, Kelley Blue Book cited an average cost
        (including optional features) of US$47,174 for a new Ford F-150.[5]

        The Silverado nameplate made its debut for the 1975 model year, becoming the top trim level on all Chevrolet C/K
        trucks,[3] slotted above Custom Deluxe, Scottsdale, and Cheyenne. At the same time, GMC C/K trucks used
        variations of the Sierra name (Sierra, Sierra Classic, Sierra Grande, and High Sierra). Today, Chevrolet still
        uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes to denote a 2-wheel rear drive (CC), or a four-wheel drive
        (CK)
