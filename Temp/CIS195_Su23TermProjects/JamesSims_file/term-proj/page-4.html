        On December 13, 2012, the redesigned 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra were both introduced in Detroit,
        Michigan, later making their public debut at the North American International Auto Show. GM dropped the 900
        platform and changed to K2XX. The third generation Silverado 1500 has three gas engine options; a 4.3 L EcoTec3
        V6, a 5.3 L EcoTec3 V8, and a 6.2 L EcoTec3 V8. Chevrolet's MyLink touch-screen multimedia interface system
        became available on most models. It included A2DP stereo streaming technologies, Bluetooth hands-free telephone,
        USB hookups, and an input for an Apple iPod or iPhone. When connected via the USB port, an iPhone 4/4S, iPhone
        5/iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, or iPhone 6 Plus is able to stream music from Pandora Radio. A Bose premium audio system,
        as well as a Bose surround sound audio system is available on most models. OnStar became standard on all models.

        Underneath, the Silverado rides on a fully boxed high-strength steel frame with hydroforming technology; truck
        cab's frame is built with high strength steel as well. The third generation Silverado uses aluminum on the hood,
        for the engine block and for the control arms in order to save mass. The truck's bed is made of roll-formed
        steel instead of stamped steel used by other manufacturers in order to save weight and gain strength. The third
        generation Silverado introduced the all-new upmarket top-of-the-line "High Country" trim level which includes
        saddle brown leather interior, which is Chevrolet's first entry into the luxury truck market. A fully-squared
        front end takes styling cues from the 1994â€“1998 C/K trucks, and on Z71 models, a Z71 badge was added to the
        front grille. The first production Silverado completed assembly on April 29, 2013. The Silverado 1500 went on
        sale in May 2013 as a 2014 model, with the Silverado HD being available in early 2014 for the 2015 model year.
        On January 10, 2014, a recall was issued for 370,000 Silverado and Sierra pickups due to a fire risk.[24
