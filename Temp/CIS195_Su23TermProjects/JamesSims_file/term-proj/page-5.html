    <p>
        As of 2011, the Chevrolet and GMC Heavy Duty models have been upgraded with a new fully boxed high strength
        steel frame from front to rear improving stiffness by 92% with bigger rear springs, larger engine and
        transmission mounts and new hydraulic body mounts to improve the ride. The front suspension incorporates new
        upper and lower control arms and new torsion bars tailored to one of five different gross axle weight ratings.
        Upper control arms are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms,
        while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity. Using a unique torsion bar for each gross
        weight rating allows for better control over vehicle height, resulting in improved handling and better alignment
        for reduced tire wear. These improvements allow for up to a 6,000-pound front axle weight rating, allowing all
        4WD trucks to accommodate a snowplow.

        n contrast to smaller Silverado pickup trucks, the 4500-6500HD is only offered as a chassis cab vehicle intended
        for the addition of rear bodywork (by second-party manufacturers). Alongside the International CV, it is
        marketed in two-door or four-door cabs with rear-wheel or 4x4 drive. Competing against the Ford F-450/F-550
        Super Duty and Ram 4500-5500, the model line is a Class 4-6 truck. Both Chevrolet and International vehicles are
        powered by a 350 horsepower (260 kW) variant of the Duramax 6.6L V8 diesel paired with an Allison 1000 or 2000
        series automatic transmission
