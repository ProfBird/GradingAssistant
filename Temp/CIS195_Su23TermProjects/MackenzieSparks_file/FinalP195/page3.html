        <h2>Local Shops vs. Online Shops</h2>
        <p>There are countless places to buy sunflower seeds online. A perk of buying online is there is a
            vast
            amount of varieties to choose from. You can find rare and unique flowers that aren't often seen in a
            everyday garden.</p>

        <p>While no one can deny that the internet has so many wonderful options to buy plans, sunflowers are
            wonderful all on their own, and I personally love supporting local buisinesses. Below I will list
            some of
            my favorite local shops here in Eugene, OR.</p>
