        <h2>How did sunflowers get their name?</h2>
        <blockquote>"You can probably guess how sunflowers got their name. It’s simply because young sunflowers move to
            face the
            sun! They just love basking in the rays and can't get enough of that vitamin D. If you want to get technical
            though. Their scientific name is helianthus. This comes from the Greek word for ‘sun’ which is ‘helios’ and
            ‘flower’ which is 'anthus'.

            In Greek mythology, the story goes that a nymph named Clytie was in love with Apollo, the God of Sun. In the
            beginning, he loved her too, but then his head was turned toward another nymph. In a fit of jealous rage,
            Clytie told the other nymphs' father, who then buried his daughter alive as punishment. Pretty brutal!
            Apollo was so angry that he then turned Clytie into a sunflower. But, as her love for him was so strong, she
            watched him move across the sky every day, just how sunflowers follow the sun."-<cite>Bloom&Wild.com</cite>

        <h2>Sunflower meanings</h2>
        <blockquote>While sunflowers come in a range of warm colors, from golden to orange, red, and purple, they are
            most known for their vibrant yellow color. As the color yellow represents joy, happiness, and laughter,
            these qualities are what the sunflower embodies. Sunflowers are famous for turning their big round faces
            towards the sun. For this reason, they are also symbols of optimism. Sunflowers, quite literally, look to
            the bright side.

            Like the sun’s own radiance, sunflowers send positive vibes. They are the perfect flowers to bring more joy
            to a garden or to put a smile on someone’s face. Optimism is also a form of gratitude in that it honors the
            many gifts in life. So, sunflowers also make lovely thank you gifts.<cite>uniguide.com</cite></blockquote>

        <h2>Sunflowers can cleanse the world</h2>
        <blockquote>Sunflowers have a remarkable ability to absorb toxins, including toxic metals and radiation.
            Following nuclear disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, scientists planted millions of sunflowers to
            help the land recover Similarly, they’ve also been planted in areas with high concentrations of lead.

            In scientific terms, they’re ‘hyperaccumulators’ which means they can absorb much more of these contaminants
            than other plants. It’s believed plants develop this ability partly to make them less tempting as a snack
            for herbivores. <cite>appleyardflowers.com</cite></blockquote>
