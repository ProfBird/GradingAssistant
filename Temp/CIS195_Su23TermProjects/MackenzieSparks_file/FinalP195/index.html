        <h2>My Garden</h2>
        <p>Every year I like to plant an assortment of flowers. Nothing crazy, just a happy snack for the neighborhood
            bees and butterflies. Come springtime, I am out in my yard with bags of soil and packets of seeds. And every
            year, my wonderful neighbor shares some of her sunflowers-starts. This year I thought I would change it up
            and add some different varieties of sunflower seeds so the ones I was gifted are not alone. </p>

        <h2>Why Sunflowers Are So Loved</h2>
        <p>
            "Sunflowers symbolise loyalty, adoration thanks to the myth of Clytie and Apollo. And, because of their
            association with the sun, sunflowers are well-known for being a happy flower and the perfect bloom for a
            summer flower delivery to brighten someone's mood! But, they actually have different meanings across
            cultures. In China, sunflowers symbolise long life, vitality and good luck. And to Native Americans
            sunflowers symbolised harvest and provision. Basically no matter where you are, sunflowers are a positive
            flower that brings joy to many!"<em>-Bloom and Wild Website</em>
