            <h2>Random Encounter Charts</h2>
            <span>This is a collection of random encounter charts I have used in my campaigns. Depending on the circumstances, the probability of an encounter changes, but for ease of use all of these charts have a 50% chance of an encounter. To determine an encounter, choose a environment that the characters are in (i.e. Forest, City), roll a d100, and consult the "Roll" column on the chart.</span>
